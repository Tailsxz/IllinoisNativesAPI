The leaves are large and arrow-shaped. This species blooms from May through June. The flowers are on a club-shaped structure called a spadix that is surrounded by a leaflike, elongated spathe. The flowers do not have petals or sepals. Fruits are green berries. Flies are attracted by the smell from the flowers and act as pollinators as they feed on the pollen.

Flowering occurs from June through October. One flower head is produced per plant, although sometimes the plant branches near the base and produces one flower per stem. The flower head contains many small flowers that are of two types: yellow ray flowers (10 to 20 per flower head), about three-fourths inch long; and purple‐brown, tubular flowers in the dome‐shaped center. Some individual plants may have pale‐yellow ray flowers with white tips. Each flower head is about two and one‐half to two and three‐fourths inches wide.
